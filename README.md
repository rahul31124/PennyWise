# PennyWise - Offline Expense Tracker

PennyWise is a **minimal, offline expense tracking app** built using **Flutter**.  
It helps users track income and expenses locally, visualize spending patterns, and stay in control of their money **without accounts, ads, or cloud dependency**.

This project was built as a **learning + real-world product** to explore Flutter app architecture, local databases, and thoughtful UI design, while still being genuinely useful for everyday users.
